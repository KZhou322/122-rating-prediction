### cluster.py
This script should be run in a folder containing the data file 'user_history.csv' using the command 'python cluster.py'. It will cluster the website history data and generate two graphs, which the user can choose to save, and will automatically create the following files:
cluster_labels.npy
centroids.npy
ids.npy
where the cluster labels and ids files indicate which user ids belong to which cluster. The centroids file indicates the centroids of the three clusters generated.
